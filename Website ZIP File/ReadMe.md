If there is errors when trying to open the code, it probably means you need to extract it first. 
If there is any problems with the code (eg code not there, pages not loading, etc ) please contact Matthew.

(Code was deleted because it was outdated, it will be added ASAP, most likely Monday as I have not had access to the CR1 Computers)
