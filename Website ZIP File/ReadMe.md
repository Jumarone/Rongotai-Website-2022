If you get an error saying "Blocked" when trying to open one of the HTML files, that is because 
you need to extract it. Open the zip file, you will see "mc website test". Right click on that 
file and click copy, then paste the Mc Website test onto your desktop. After that open the one on 
your desktop, then open the html files from there. There should be no errors. 

Contact Matthew if you have any issues e.g code isn't there, webpage not there etc
